# Traffic and EV Charging Demand Forecasting using Time Series and Deep Learning

This project explores the intersection of traffic forecasting and electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using time series analysis, deep learning, and hierarchical modeling techniques. The focus is on leveraging real-world traffic data and EV usage patterns to build intelligent systems for **path planning**, **demand prediction**, and **infrastructure optimization**.

##  Project Objectives

### 1. **Path Planning Based on Traffic Flow Forecasting**
- Forecast hourly traffic volume using statistical and deep learning models.
- Enable congestion-aware routing by predicting future flow.

### 2. **Forecasting EV Charging Demand at Different Aggregation Levels**
- Use traffic and EV datasets to model charging behavior.
- Predict charging demand at the station, city, or regional level using advanced time series methods.
